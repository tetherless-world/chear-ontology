# chear-ontology

To build the ontology:

```
invoke build
```

If you are doing this for the first time, you need to install the software correctly:

```
virtualenv -p `python3` --no-site-packages venv/
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're coming back to rebuild, be sure to activate the virtual environment again:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
